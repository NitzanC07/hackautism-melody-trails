# Hackotism - Melody Trails
Melody Trails is a music education platform developed as part of Hackutism, a hackathon focused on the subject of autism. Designed to help students, teachers, and parents learn and teach music with a focus on improving musical hearing, the application offers a range of interactive learning tools and resources. As the developer of Melody Trails, I utilized React to build the application, working closely with the rest of the development team to create a user-friendly platform that is sure to become a valuable resource for anyone looking to improve their musical abilities. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced musician, Melody Trails has something to offer for everyone. By participating in Hackutism, we hope to make a positive impact on the lives of individuals with autism and their families.
